could use this as a means of encrypted file transfer to server of my own


client must send encrypted data only in chunks of four kibibytes (4096 bytes)


explodes after a certain amount of time. the server will delete everything after a certain amount of time after inactivity


when doing the encryption, we are doing it in 4096 byte chunks. so essentially 4 kibibytes. before the encryption happens, we can implement compression but that can be at a later date.
